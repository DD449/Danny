<p style="font-size:25px;"> <b> Interest In IT </b></p>  
<p> As a kid I always wondered what coding games were like but as I grew older I also looked at how coding helps us on a daily basis other than games, when it comes to consoles, phones , fridges, gps and other electrical devices that improve society. Information Technology sparked my interest more once I started to study it in high school. I spent 2 years studying the subject in high school which helped me find a pathway for a career such as being an IT help Desk Technician, Video Game Designer, Mobile Application Developer or a Web developer. I chose to come RMIT because I have heard that this university is great for teaching IT since its known for being a university of technology, I expect to learn information that will help lead me to one of the career paths I have mentioned above, such as learning how to use python for coding or learning how to determine the problem of a computer systems hardware and knowing how to fix it and as well as knowing how to use the correct method of data storage / management solutions. </p>
