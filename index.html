<h2>About Me</h2>

<h1 style="background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 60%);">Interest In IT</h1>  
<p> As a kid I always wondered what coding games were like but as I grew older I also looked at how coding helps us on a daily basis other than games, when it comes to consoles, phones , fridges, gps and other electrical devices that improve society. Information Technology sparked my interest more once I started to study it in high school. I spent 2 years studying the subject in high school which helped me find a pathway for a career such as being an IT help Desk Technician, Video Game Designer, Mobile Application Developer or a Web developer. I chose to come RMIT because I have heard that this university is great for teaching IT since its known for being a university of technology, I expect to learn information that will help lead me to one of the career paths I have mentioned above, such as learning how to use python for coding or learning how to determine the problem of a computer systems hardware and knowing how to fix it and as well as knowing how to use the correct method of data storage / management solutions. </p>

<p> This job is a hands-on job on being a Computer Repair Technician, which basically is a person who would help customers fix problems with their computers: Virus removals, Windows repairs / Windows installation and internet issues. I really enjoy building computers and especially knowing how to fix them is an interest I definitely enjoy, it's like people who like cars but instead it's with computer parts. Nowadays computers are very high demanding which also is a strong reason to take this job.
     The key skills required for this job are to know: </p> 
     
<p> - Complex problem diagnosing on Windows and Mac operating systems. <br> - Basic understanding of networking. <br> - Ability to work under pressure. <br> - Ability to work autonomously. <br> - Strong communication skills both internally within the company, and externally to clients using written and oral communication methods. <br> - Strong time management skills. <br> - Current driver's license <br> - Professional attitude and work ethic and desire to deliver market-leading customer service. </p>

<p> The skills I have to do this job are at an intermediate level, I have built many computers and have fixed them but I wouldn’t say that I’m an expert since I have not worked in a proper field of Computer Repairing since I have been learning from the internet. I have worked in the retail industry before so I know how to deal with customer service at an expertise level where my communication skills are strong within the workforce and to customers. I also have a strong ability to work under pressure getting the job done efficiently and effectively. </p>

<p> In order to get the skills and knowledge of Computer Repair Technician I will be learning a Bachelor of IT at RMIT in order to grow my skills which can help me become an expert in the field of repairing computers. </p>
