<h1>Interest In IT</h1>
<p> As a kid I always wondered what coding games were like but as I grew older I also looked at how coding helps us on a daily basis other than games, when it comes to consoles, phones , fridges, gps and other electrical devices that improve society. Information Technology sparked my interest more once I started to study it in high school. I spent 2 years studying the subject in high school which helped me find a pathway for a career such as being an IT help Desk Technician, Video Game Designer, Mobile Application Developer or a Web developer. I chose to come RMIT because I have heard that this university is great for teaching IT since its known for being a university of technology, I expect to learn information that will help lead me to one of the career paths I have mentioned above, such as learning how to use python for coding or learning how to determine the problem of a computer systems hardware and knowing how to fix it and as well as knowing how to use the correct method of data storage / management solutions. </p>

<h1>Ideal Job</h1>
<p> This job is a hands-on job on being a Computer Repair Technician, which basically is a person who would help customers fix problems with their computers: Virus removals, Windows repairs / Windows installation and internet issues. I really enjoy building computers and especially knowing how to fix them is an interest I definitely enjoy, it's like people who like cars but instead it's with computer parts. Nowadays computers are very high demanding which also is a strong reason to take this job.
     The key skills required for this job are to know: </p>
<p> - Complex problem diagnosing on Windows and Mac operating systems. <br> - Basic understanding of networking. <br> - Ability to work under pressure. <br> - Ability to work autonomously. <br> - Strong communication skills both internally within the company, and externally to clients using written and oral communication methods. <br> - Strong time management skills. <br> - Current driver's license <br> - Professional attitude and work ethic and desire to deliver market-leading customer service. </p>

<p> The skills I have to do this job are at an intermediate level, I have built many computers and have fixed them but I wouldn’t say that I’m an expert since I have not worked in a proper field of Computer Repairing since I have been learning from the internet. I have worked in the retail industry before so I know how to deal with customer service at an expertise level where my communication skills are strong within the workforce and to customers. I also have a strong ability to work under pressure getting the job done efficiently and effectively. </p>

<p> In order to get the skills and knowledge of Computer Repair Technician I will be learning a Bachelor of IT at RMIT in order to grow my skills which can help me become an expert in the field of repairing computers. </p>

<p> The 3 tests show that I sit around the average level when it comes to personality traits, Problem solving and as well as my creativity. It suggest that I should work on some skills such as being less judging and turbulent  which is a negative trait to have as a person in general, although this shouldn’t influence the behaviour of the team since I tend to keep these things to myself, furthermore I  do like to take care of people and put them in front of my needs sometimes which is very helpful for a sign of teamwork and companionship in the workforce, building confidence in one another is the key to a stable workforce.  </p>

<h1>About My Project</h1>
<p> <b> Overview </b> <br> I want to focus on making a game that can be good by focusing on aspects of certain games and combining them into 1, by making a game that can focus on a progression level system like ARPG (action role playing games) this can have the player flow through the game smoothly by progressing step by step, e.g could be next chapter is unlocked after beating a certain boss. Also to include things like a survival crafting system as well which the player needs to build and craft and finally a coop or solo experience for people who want to bring the fun alone or together with friends. </p>
<p> <b> Motivation </b> <br> I suggest this project will be rather interesting because after playing lots of video games from 2008 there have been tons of games that are fun to play but in the end most of these games always have a strong flaw to it. For example Minecraft has over 140 million players, while the game is fun in its aspect of survival, building and crafting mechanics it lacks a major flaw with progression, one you can be on the weakest tier of items then you can jump to like the best tier items after like 1 hour into the game this therefore leads its lack of excitement when playing which players tend to get bored and only have the fun of building. This shows that the genre of survival and crafting is lacking and only takes account of its building mechanics. “It takes a lot to make a game to satisfy a lot of the players out there” </p>
<p> <b> Description </b> <br> The game I will be making is a work in progress so there is no proper name for it but let’s call it project X. This will  be a game where it takes the most played genre of video games and combines those characteristics into 1, in order to make a game that interests a large player base. Looking at statistics in 2020 the top played gaming genres have been action games, adventure games , role playing games and coop/multiplayer. So the game will have to focus on being balanced with the genres being implemented, this means that all aspects of the game is perfectly balanced and isn’t one sided to what the game is good for, for example the adventuring story has an amazing story but the  gameplay is rather lacking. By focusing on this I can build a service that can finally put gamers at a place where they don’t have to make the decision of “what to play” or “I have no games to play” at last. It will be challenging to make a perfect game but by gathering inspiration from other games that do  well in its certain genres, this will take a lot of time to plan what is required to make the balanced game possible.
The features of this game will be focusing on the story line, a good game isn’t a good game without a story to tell. By researching top games that have are known for its good story, I realised that most of the games are very cliff hangy which intrigues the player more, on top of that the protagonist of the story always has a strong emotional past and then following up with the Confidant (the protagonist close friend)  that make the story even better, doing this make players have that connection within the character.
The second feature we will be looking at is to focus on a ARPG (action role playing game) an role playing game is essentially in which players take roles of fictional characters, let say you play as the tank class, your role is to be the frontline of the team. Games like this bring a diversity to what players want to play, it’s kind of like a personality trait for what class you want to go.  A  healer can define the person as  supportive and wants to help people, other than that most popular games like dark souls, terraria and final fantasy have the same thing in common, being rpg style games. To make a game with lots of diversity in its RPG style I would include around 10 classes to pick from so it would make the player feel like there  is the right class and what feels right for them, basically every person should have a playstyle for the game.
Thirdly, the final feature that will be included is to focus on how a building mechanic can work so that it also pushes the player to be as creative as possible in a different way where it’s almost impossible to have the same idea as someone else, including a defence mode that could challenge players to trial and error a strategy from time to time. </p>
<p> <b> Tools and Technology </b> <br> Making a game takes a lot of skill especially with programming, a very good reliable program to use for this is to be using Unity, this allows a lot of various things to  be done such as modeling and creating assets, programming assets so that it can be interacted with and finally since unity uses C++ it is one of the reliable technologies to use today since its been used for our favourite consoles and games. </p>  
<p> <b> Skills required </b> <br> In order to start “Project x” it is suggested that I have knowledge on how to use unity, this may be with scripting, textures or animations, familiarity with designing and planning, experience with game physics and game development. Learning how to acquire some of these skills will take lots of practice since unity is a high level programming language but everything is always possible to do so if you take dedication and practice into these things. </p>
<p> <b> Outcome</b> <br> I’m hoping that if this Project X happens, that it will be a success because I believe that nowadays there aren’t many good games out there to play. I want to make sure that all aspects are capable of making the game perfect without having major flaws.

<h1> Here are some games that I took inspiration from </h1>
<p> <b> 7 Days to Die <b> </p>
<img src="game1.jpg" alt="7 Days to Die" width=1280 height="720">
<p> 7 Days to Die is a zombie survival rpg game which really focuses on building and survivng  in an apocolypse, it's great with friends. </p> 
<br>
<p> <b> Minecraft <b> <p>
<img src="game2.jpg" alt="Minecraft" width=1280 height="720">     
<p> Minecraft is a sandbox building/survival game which does really well in that field of genre but lacks progression in the story, it's great with friends. </p>   
<br> 
<p> <b> Final Fantasy XV <b> <p>
<img src="game3.jpg" alt="Final Fantasy" width=1280 height="720">     
<p> Final Fantasy XV is a really good solo game for open world adventuring but this game will lack in its replayability since you mostly just click the attack button. </p>
<br>
<p> <b> Terraria <b> <p>
<img src="game4.jpg" alt="Terraria" width=1280 height="720">
<p> Terraria is a super fun sandbox game that has a great flow of progression in its story, this is a game that is perfection in gameplay wise, story and replayability wise. </p>
<br>
<p> <b> Detorit Become Human <b> <p>
<img src="game5.jpg" alt="Detroit Become Human" width=1280 height="720">   
<p> Detroit Become Human back in 2018 was one of the best story games out and had a perfect style of playing adventure genre. </p>
<br>
<p> <b> It takes 2 <b> <p>
<img src="game6.jpg" alt="it takes 2" width=1280 height="720">   
<p> This game is one of the best games to relate to my project, it includes putting adventure,puzzle,flying simulator, parkour style, dnd, fighting style, I could go on how many genres they implemented in there game but these genres only happen like once in the game instead of having it consistent through the game, but it makes the game fresh and less repetitive. </p>
